	<p>Made from the strong Siberian character with a pinch of culture, soaked-up from the Russian Venice, Saint-Petersburg, and now living the creative and outdoor lifestyle in the Emerald city, my name is Anna Krupp, and this is a short summary representing me:</p>
	<p>My road stretches from the theoretical science to practical application of language and consumer behavior; my undergraduate degree is in Philology and my Master's is in Social Communications. I love looking for patterns, inventing algoritms and the feeling of accomplishment when you see the results of your work. Understanding the consumer behaviour and providing the best solutions that fits the needs of the clients has always interested me.</p>
	<p>I strive to look for opportunity to learn and become better in intercultural communication. As a student I have traveled all over the world meeting new people, in the Japan, Czech Republic, Italy, Turkey and Spain to name a few, and expand my knowledge of cultural diversity of the world.</p>
	<p>I have aspirations to bridge the gap between people of different personalities, backgrounds, cultures, and needs through effective communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills. I am a lucky person who can, by her own example, show that communication between people of different cultures can be successful at every level.</p>
	<p>I am ambitious, passionate and curious; even as a child I always choose to discover new things and face myself with new challenges. I like to push out of my comfort zone and feeling the personal growth. </p>
	<p>I always loved solving problems and seeing the results of the solutions I provide, so acquiring technical skills to become a developer felt a natural decision. After challenging myself with intensive Development Bootcamp and graduating, I am trully excited to take a new step in my career as a developer. Being a developer is my personal solution to be happy: keep my mind challenged every day and my ambitions satisfied by building things and delivering products.</p>
